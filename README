Amazon Product Services API using Java.

I'm releasing this to the wild because I found it rather difficult to get Amazon Commerce Services API working.
In theory you can use Amazon's WSDL to generate Web Service stubs. For various reasons I could not get this to work.

So here is a pretty much abandoned REST client (I moved on to other projects) that uses the generated JAXB objects 
from the WSDL and Commons HTTP Client.

Copy sample.properties to a file called my.properties and add your AWS credentials and your associate tag

To Build:

	ant build

To run the sample:

	ant run
